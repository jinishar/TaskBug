# TaskBug – Task & Event Management Platform

**Project Name:** TaskBug  

TaskBug is a mobile application designed to provide a **single unified platform** for managing tasks and creating or discovering events. The project focuses on building a **clean, user‑friendly, and scalable Android application** that helps users organize work, track activities, and collaborate efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Students and young professionals often struggle to manage tasks, deadlines, and events using multiple disconnected applications. Existing tools are either too complex, limited in features, or lack flexibility for combining tasks and events in one place.

There is a need for a **simple, centralized, and intuitive mobile platform** where users can create, manage, and view tasks and events with rich details and a smooth user experience.

## Proposed Solution

TaskBug is a mobile application that combines **task management and event management** into a single platform.

The application:

- Allows users to create tasks and events  
- Enables users to add details such as images, categories, deadlines, and locations  
- Displays tasks and events in a structured, card‑based layout  
- Provides a clean and modern interface for easy navigation

## Key Features

- User Authentication (Login / Signup – UI flow)  
- Dashboard with Bottom Navigation  
- Add Task & Add Event using popup card forms  
- Image upload for tasks and events  
- Category selection and dropdowns  
- Card‑based Task and Event listing  
- Profile and Chat UI modules (planned)  
- Clean Material Design 3 interface  

---

## Innovation & Creativity

- Unified platform for both tasks and events  
- Popup card‑based forms instead of full‑screen forms  
- Dynamic display using reusable cards  
- Interactive and user‑friendly UI  
- Designed for scalability and future backend integration

## System Architecture

TaskBug follows a **Modular MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture**:

- **UI Layer** – Jetpack Compose screens and components  
- **ViewModel Layer** – Handles state and business logic  
- **Model Layer** – Data classes for tasks and events  

This architecture ensures clean separation of concerns and easy scalability.
